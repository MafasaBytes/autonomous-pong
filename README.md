# Pong
Reinforcement Learning Agent for Pong
This project aims to develop a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent capable of autonomously learning and playing the game Pong using a neural network. By training the agent to learn from its interactions with the game environment, this research illustrates the potential of RL in game-based AI development, where agents can achieve human-level performance without explicit programming.
